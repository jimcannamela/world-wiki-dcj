  <section class="location-details">
    <p>New Xanthe is located in the Xanthe Terra region of Mars, which is known for its rugged and diverse terrain. The area surrounding the colony is characterized by rolling hills, mesas, and canyons, with occasional outcroppings of exposed bedrock. The soil in the region is rich in iron and other minerals, which give it a distinctive reddish-brown color.</p>
    <p>The colony itself is situated in a relatively flat area of the Xanthe Terra region, surrounded by hills and canyons. The primary features of the colony are its domed habitats, which are scattered across the landscape. Each habitat is designed to house up to 100 people and is constructed from durable materials that can withstand the harsh Martian environment. The domes are equipped with airlocks, heating and cooling systems, and other amenities to make them habitable.</p>
    <p>In addition to the domes, the colony also features a variety of support buildings, including research facilities, power stations, and greenhouse modules. The research facilities are used to conduct experiments in fields such as biology, geology, and planetary science. The power stations are powered by arrays of solar panels, which are positioned to maximize their exposure to the sun's rays. The greenhouse modules are used to grow crops and other plants, which help to provide a source of fresh food for the colony's residents.</p>
    <p>The landscape surrounding the colony is also home to a number of features that are of scientific interest, including ancient riverbeds and canyons. These features are being studied by the colony's scientists in an effort to better understand the planet's geological history and the potential for future exploration and colonization.</p>
    <p>Overall, the New Xanthe colony is a testament to human ingenuity and perseverance, as well as our desire to explore and understand the universe around us.</p>
