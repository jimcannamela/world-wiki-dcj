      1. Start with a generic concept for your world. Is it a wasteland? A paradise? A giant ball of cheese?

      2. Once you have a good generic idea, come up with a name for your world and fill in the blank below.

      Tip: If you have trouble coming up with ideas, you are free to use random generators online. Here are a couple to try:
      https://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/planet-descriptions.php
      https://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/planet-names.php
      https://codebeautify.org/random-environment-generator
      https://www.random.org/

      Feel free to use generated names and text blocks if it helps move your group forward. If none of the ones above are what you are looking for, some quick googling for "random X generator" usually yields some useful tools.

      <!-- 3. Write up a short, single paragraph description for your world. -->
      New Xanthe is the capital city of the United Confederation of New Xanthe. A real world that is part of a future reality, where humans have colonized the red planet, Mars. The colony is the brainchild of tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, who, through his company SpaceX, has developed the technology to transport humans and supplies to Mars. Musk conducted his first trip to the colony utilizing his Mars-bound spacecraft "Heart of Gold". The colony was founded in the year 2056 and is situated in the Xanthe Terra region of Mars, which is known for its ancient riverbeds and canyons.
